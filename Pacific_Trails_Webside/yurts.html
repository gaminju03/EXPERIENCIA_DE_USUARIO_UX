            What is a yurt?
            <br>
            <dd>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                    the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                    a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                How are the yurts furnished?
                <br>
                <dd>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                    quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping 
                    experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                    cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                    located in the lodge.

                What should I bring?
                <br>
                <dd>
                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                    dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                    It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
                    adventure!
